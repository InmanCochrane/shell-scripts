# shell-scripts
Personal shell scripts, here to share with colleagues and others.

This repo is not particularly designed for typical `git` interaction. I haven't even tested what happens if its `.git` directory would cause problems for, as I have things set up, ZSH or Bash to source all files within a directory. (The simple fix that I haven't yet done is to make the sourcing only source `*.sh`; go for it if you want to).

PRs welcome.
